This package is developed and mantained by the
<a href="https://www.chi2labs.com/">Chi2Labs</a> team.

Inspired on an initial contribution by

## Disclaimer

This package is not provided nor endorsed by Amazon. Use it at your own
risk.

## Installation

You can install from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("cognitoR")
```

Or from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("chi2labs/cognitoR")
```

## Requirements

You need to have:

  - Amazon AWS account.

## About Amazon Cognito

If you do not have experience with Amazon Cognito, It is recommended to
read the official documentation: [Amazon
Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html)

## How it works ?

When a user accesses to your Shiny application with CognitoR, the user
is redirected to your configured url in Amazon Cognito, there if user is
not logged in, a login page will appear.

If the user is already logged or successful authentication is
accomplished , the user is redirected back to your Shiny App with a
code/token (depending of your configuration) in the url.

If the app is loaded with a code will get a token via oauth (this code
can be used only once). If the app already has the token (via url or
received it using the code) it will check authorization with Amazon
Cognito via an OAUTH request using the token. A valid authorization will
allow the Shiny app lo load, the user will be redirected back to the
login page.

## Steps

### 1 - Go to Amazon Cognito

Once you have logged with your Amazon AWS account, go to “Cognito”
service and click on “Manage User Pools”.

### 2 - Create a User Pool

<img src="man/figures/cognito2.png" width=500 />

Name your user pool:

<img src="man/figures/cognito3.png" width=500 />

Create a client application (Application that will work with this user
pool):

<img src="man/figures/cognito4.png" width=500 />
<img src="man/figures/cognito5.png" width=500 />

This will generate the client id and the client secret you will need to
configure your shinyapp.

### 3 -Configure your domain for your Login Form

Go to App Integration -\> Domain Name, to set the url for login form,
you can use a Amazon subdomain or use your own domain.

<img src="man/figures/cognito6.png" width=500 />

Also remember the url for your configuration.

### 4 - Settings for Application

Go to App Integration -\> App Client Settings and you must:

  - Enable Identity provider: Cognito User Pool
  - Set the “Callback URL” (Where will be redirect the user when login
    is succesful)
  - Set the “Sign Out Url” (Where will be redirect the user when logout
    is successful).
  - Enable OAuth 2.0 : You have support for “Authorization Code Grant”
    (recommended) and “Implicit Grant”.
  - Enable “Allowed OAuth Scope” (recommended: email and openid).
  - Save setting.

Your basic configuration in Amazon Cognito is ready.

### 5 - Configuration of your Shiny application with Amazon Cognito.

This package requires that you have a configuration file (“config.yml”)
in your application folder with the following structure:

  - group\_name: The User Pool Name.
  - oauth\_flow: Flow configured,(“code” for Authorization code grant
    flow or “token” for Implicit grant)
  - base\_cognito\_url: Your domain url for Client App.
  - app\_client\_id: Your app client id.
  - app\_client\_secret: Your app client secret id.
  - redirect\_uri: Url configured in “Callback URL”
  - redirect\_uri\_logout: Url configured in “Sign Out Url”

Example:

``` yml
default:
  cognito:
    group_name: "YOUR_POOL_NAME"
    oauth_flow: "code"
    base_cognito_url: "https://your_domain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com"
    app_client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    app_client_secret: "YOUR_SECRET_ID"
    redirect_uri: "YOUR_APP_URL"
    redirect_uri_logout: "YOUR_APP_URL"
```

### 6 - Add Support to your Shiny App

An example app can be found in
[inst/examples/simple-login-app.R](https://github.com/chi2labs/cognitoR/blob/master/inst/examples/simple-login-app.R).

The package has two main functions `cognito_ui()` and
`cognito_server()`. `cognito_ui()` loads required UI for Cognito Module.
`cognito_server()` which takes care of the logic and interaction with
Cognito API. This method also returns reactive elements for:

  - Checking if user is logged in.
  - Redirecting to Amazon Cognito Login Page configured if user is not
    logged in.
  - Getting data for the authenticated user.
  - Callback for Logout of Amazon Cognito.

The example mentioned above includes the use of the Logout module
(`logout_ui()` and `logout_server()`) which provide a “logout” button
interacting with the reactive “isLogged” returned from Cognito Module to
show the button and with the logout callback when button is pressed.

### 7 - Run your app

You will be redirect to Cognito Login Form , there you can create your
account and log in.

<img src="man/figures/cognito8.png" width=500 />

Upon successful authentication, you will be redirect to your app:

<img src="man/figures/cognito9.png" width=500 />

### 8 - Running example application

The example app can be found in
[inst/examples/simple-login-app.R](https://github.com/chi2labs/cognitoR/blob/master/inst/examples/simple-login-app.R).

This app work with a config.yml configured to work with a Cognito
instance of Chi2labs, this instance not allow to create user and is
required that you run this shiny app using the port 5000 (because
Cognito instance is configured to expect this port).

``` r
options(shiny.port = 5000)
runApp('inst/examples/simple-login-app.R')
```

You can test the application with these credentials:

  - user: “demo”  
  - password: “password”
